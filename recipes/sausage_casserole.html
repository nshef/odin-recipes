	<h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>3 tbsp olive oil, plus an extra drizzle (optional)</li>
		<li>8 large pork sausages</li>
		<li>1 onion, finely sliced</li>
		<li>Sprinkle of golden caster sugar</li>
		<li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
		<li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
		<li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
		<li>100ml red wine</li>
		<li>2 bay leaves</li>
		<li>400g can butter beans, drained but not rinsed</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="ingredients-sub">For the crumb topping (optional)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>50g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
		<li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
		<li>handful of parsley leaves, roughly chopped</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7</li>
		<li>Heat 1tbsp of the oil in a shallow ovenproof casserole over medium heat and gently fry the sausages for 5-8 minutes, or until brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate using tongs</li>
		<li>Tip the onions into the pan and fry for 5-8 minutes until beginning to turn golden</li>
		<li>Drizzle in a little more oil if the onions start to stick</li>
		<li>Sprinkle in the sugar and cook for a minute before stirring in the vinegar, tomato purée and paprika to form a paste</li>
		<li>Tip in the tomatoes, then pour the wine into the tomato can, swish it round, and add to the pan</li>
		<li>Sitr in the bay leaves and beans, then arrange the sausages on top so they're half-submerged in the sauce but still a little exposed</li>
		<li>Bring the mixture to a simmer, then bake in the oven for 20 minutes</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, mix the breadcrumbs with the garlic and parsley, then season and stir in 1 tbsp oil</li>
		<li>Scatter the topping over the casserole, then drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and bake for 10 minutes more until the breadcrumbs are golden and crisp. Leave to stand for a few minutes, then take to the table and serve from the dish</li>
	</ol>
