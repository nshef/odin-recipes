	<h2 class="description">Description</h2>
	<p>I was initially underwhelmed by my Instant Pot while I was trying to understand exactly what types of recipes it was useful for. However, this butter chicken completely changed my mind. It literally could not be easier, and makes restaurant-quality curry so good that this recipe alone got the creator a cookbook deal.</p>
	<p>This must be served over rice with naan, no question.</p>

	<h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe originally had American measurements (i.e., ounces and pounds), but I have converted them as accurately as possible to use UK ingredients.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1 400g can tomatoes (I used chopped tomatoes to avoid blending on the last step; otherwise use whole)</li>
		<li>5-6 cloves garlic</li>
		<li>1-2 tsp minced ginger</li>
		<li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
		<li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
		<li>1 tsp garam masala, plus an additional 1 tsp for finishing</li>
		<li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
		<li>500g chicken thigh fillets</li>
		<li>115g unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
		<li>120ml double cream</li>
		<li>1/4-1/2 cup chopped coriander</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Place all the ingredits into an Instant Pot in the order listed <strong>except</strong> for the butter, cream, coriander and 1 tsp of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of it</li>
		<li>Close the cooker and set for 10 minutes on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure</li>
		<li>Open the pot and remove the chicken and slice into bite-sized chunks</li>
		<li>Blend together all of the remaining ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender</li>
		<li>Let the sauce cool slightly, then add the butter, cream, coriander and garam masala and stir well until incorporated</li>
		<li>Add the chicken back in and heat through</li>
		<li>Serve over rice</li>
	</ol>
