	<h2 class="description">Description</h2>
	<p>A quick, easy midweek supper that's meatless but easily enjoyed even by the omnivores. The stew is hearty and filling while the halloumi adds a delicious tang that contrasts the richness of the stew.</p>
	<p>This dish <strong>must</strong> be served with some crusty bread--or, even better, garlic bread--to sop up the remnants of the stew.</p>

	<h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>

	</ul>

	<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
